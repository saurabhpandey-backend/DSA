# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 📌 About
- Currently, DSA is being taught in my college using **C language**.
- I am first focusing on **understanding the core concepts** of DSA.
- After gaining conceptual clarity, I am **re-implementing the same DSA topics in Java** to strengthen my backend development skills.

## 🎯 Objective
- Build strong problem-solving skills
- Understand DSA concepts independent of programming language
- Prepare for backend developer interviews using Java

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Recursion
- Searching & Sorting

## 🛠️ Language
- C (for academic learning)
- Java (for backend and interview preparation)

## 🚀 Goal
To develop a solid foundation in DSA and apply it effectively in real-world Java backend applications.
